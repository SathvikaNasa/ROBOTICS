Robotics is a technology which reduces work burden for humans and machines.
It deals with the designing and operation of robots.
It can also implement machines that can helpful for humans in variety of ways.
Ex: - robotic toys, robots in restaurants for share up labour gaps.
Invention of Robotics: -
In the year 1950s by George C.  He developed first Robot: - “UNIMATE”
Development of robots involves: - computer programming code,
                                                         Electrical Engineers design.
Types of robots: -
Pre-programmed = they simply do their work and they cannot change their work to other.
Humanoid = It have a similar appearance with human.
Autonomous = It acts without make use of human. It takes place in open environment.
Teleoperated = It can be controlled by humans and mostly works in weather conditions.
Augmenting = It replace the capabilities that a person lost.
Components of robots: - 
Power supply
Actuators
Electric motors
Sensor
controller
